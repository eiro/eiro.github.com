% About me

> on me traite d'adulescent! encore un concept pété inventé par des grands.

As we all have to introduce ourselves when we join a community, i decided to
maintain a single, up to date reference about me.

# My live

I live at Strasbourg, France (close to Germany), got maried and 2 almost bachelors.

I'm "ethical vegetarian" since 2008, wannabe vegan and kinda activist.
[Earthlings](http://earthlings.com) reflects my position. But i don't judge
anyone as i'm guitly, myself, not beeing vegan.

I grew up in open innovation (comupter clubs worked this way) and learned about
GPL onlyin 90's (linux, perl, vi, ... since circa 1995). Nothing competes with
vim in my heart. i'm in the process of replacing perl with raku and linux with
openbsd.

To me, free software is not only about the obvious superiority of open inovation
to build good software: it's also about my political points of view about
convivialism and freedom.

# As member of the OSS community

I authored and i maintain some modules on _CPAN, wrote
[cpan2port](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/cpan2port)
as a helper while installing [koha](http://koha-community.org/)
on mac using [macports](https://www.macports.org/)
(i worked at [Biblibrel](http://www.biblibre.com/en) then).

i wrote some parts of [koha](http://koha-community.org/),
[sympa](http://sympa.org/), and patches to many open source
projects (dh-make-perl, zsh, sqlite, perl, raku documentation, ...).

I got some projects, modules and rcfiles on _GHEIRO.

I'm vice-president of the "_MONGUEURS",
I'm also involved in the OSS events (as organizer or/and speaker).

# my programming journey

today, i'm aware that

* there is _NOSILVERBULLET and we all have to be polyglot.
* _ACMEISM is a good thing
* documentation and tests must preceed implementation
* if you want to learn to program, learn to "not program" instead
  (i mean: are you sure you're already a poweruser of the already available tools?)

it started long time ago

* '80: programming useless stuff in logo, basic: just learning.
* early '90: gave a chance to pascal before choosing C
* late '90: discovered unix toolchain (shell, build automations, editors ...)
  and fall in love with _PERL.
* early 2000s, i gave a chance to _PYTHON, _RUBY and _LUA. Ruby has some
  things perl5 can be jalous of (_PERL6 push them even further) but all
  of them miss all the good things we learnt from
  unix culture and the awesome [perl ecosystem](http://cpan.io/). Perl and vim
  are very similar in the way that there was a time you didn't learn "_PERL"
  or "_VIM" but "the unix ecosystem", a set of tools sharing the same culture,
  _PERL and _VIM where just parts of this ecosystem so it was much more easier
  to learn than nowadays (because newcomers are comming with a completly
  different cultural background). Unix culture is not hard: it's just
  misunderstood and poorly taught.
* late 2000s: a colleague of mine introduced me to the _PLAN9 world and _CATV.
  I read some more conceptual papers on unix philosophy from people like
  [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike),
  [Russ Cox](https://swtch.com/~rsc/) (also known for _GOLANG).
  [acme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M) completly changed the way.
  i use _VIM
  (it's much more than an editor, it's my GUI for driving everything i need).
* late 2000s: a colleague of mine introduced me to the _PLAN9 world and _CATV.
  [the pugs project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs) made me aware of the
  rise of functionnal paradigm. I jumped in playing with _HASKELL and i have to
  admit i'm not productive with it but i changed the way i write my programs.
  i wrote _PERLUDE. [Nils](https://github.com/ngrunwald) introduced me to _CLOJURE
  and now i keep a eye on _PURESCRIPT, haskell, ...

Now i'm not a developper anymore and i code for fun (when i have enought time
and motivation). The [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)'s
_COMPUTERCYNICS lectures also changed the way i think computer industry.

i'm interested improving skills in many fields without having enought time.
including GUI/DataViz, low level (plan9 kernel?), functionnal programming
(finally be productive with haskell, clojure and so on).

# the tools i use

* my prefered shell is _ZSH. _UZE is my attempt to build an ecosystem on it
 (using namespaces, tests and shippable libraries).
* my prefered linux distributions are _DEBIAN when the main purpose
  is stability and _ARCH to experiment very new stuff. rpm based distributions
  desapointed me every time i tried them and the next distro i'll give a chance
  to will be _GUIX. If i have an opportunity to work with a BSD again
  (i loved the experience), it would be _NETBSD.
* _VIM is my only one editor for much more than editing (i use it as
  interactive client for RT, SQL and LDAP servers, mail composition, ...).
* my prefered window manager is _DWM but i use _GNOME at work because
  it is a much better candidate to promote linux as a desktop-ready solution
  (i actually found it much better than Mac)
* under , i use _CYGWIN, _VIM, _PUTTY, powershell,
  [git extensions](https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?)
