% About me

As we all have to introduce ourselves when we join a community, i was bored to
copy/paste partial descriptions of me, written with de mood of the day.
This page are informations on me which was already usefull to tell.

# My live

I'm maried and got 2 beloved children (pre-teenagers).
 
I live at Strasbourg, France (very close to a decent country)
work as IT production manager at _UNISTRA, the local University.
This is not a very technical position but my coworkers are awesome.

I'm "ethical vegetarian" since 2008, wannabe vegan and activist at some point.
[Earthlings](http://earthlings.com) reflects my position. But i don't judge
anyone as i'm guitly, myself, not beeing vegan.

I am linux user and member of free software community since circa 1995 (both
for ethical and technical reasons).

# As member of the OSS community

I authored and i maintain some modules on _CPAN, wrote
[cpan2port](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/cpan2port)
as a helper while installing [koha](http://koha-community.org/)
on mac using [macports](https://www.macports.org/)
(i worked at [Biblibrel](http://www.biblibre.com/en) then).

I got some projects, modules and rcfiles on _GHEIRO.

I'm vice-president of the "_MONGUEURS",
I'm also involved in the OSS events (as organizer or/and speaker).

# my programming journey

today, i'm aware that

* there is _NOSILVERBULLET and we all have to be polyglot.
* _ACMEISM is a good thing
* documentations and tests must preceed implementation
* if you want to learn to program, learn to "not program" instead
  (i mean: are you sure you're already a poweruser of the already available tools?)

it started long time ago

* '80: programming useless stuff in logo, basic: just learning.
* early '90: gave a chance to pascal before choosing C
* late '90: discovered unix toolchain (shell, build automations, editors ...)
  and fall in love with _PERL.
* early 2000s, i gave a chance to _PYTHON, _RUBY and _LUA. Ruby has some
  things perl5 can be jalous of (_PERL6 push them even further) but all
  of them miss all the good things we learnt from
  unix culture and the awesome [perl ecosystem](http://cpan.io/). Perl and vim
  are very similar in the way that there was a time you didn't learn "_PERL"
  or "_VIM" but "the unix ecosystem", a set of tools sharing the same culture,
  _PERL and _VIM where just parts of this ecosystem so it was much more easier
  to learn than nowadays (because newcomers are comming with a completly
  different cultural background). Unix culture is not hard: it's just
  misunderstood and poorly taught.
* late 2000s: a colleague of mine introduced me to the _PLAN9 world and _CATV.
  I read some more conceptual papers on unix philosophy from people like
  [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike),
  [Russ Cox](https://swtch.com/~rsc/) (also known for _GOLANG).
  [acme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M) completly changed the way.
  i use _VIM
  (it's much more than an editor, it's my GUI for driving everything i need).
* late 2000s: a colleague of mine introduced me to the _PLAN9 world and _CATV.
  [the pugs project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs) made me aware of the
  rise of functionnal paradigm. I jumped in playing with _HASKELL and i have to
  admit i'm not productive with it but i changed the way i write my programs.
  i wrote _PERLUDE. [Nils](https://github.com/ngrunwald) introduced me to _CLOJURE
  and now i keep a eye on _LIVESCRIPT and _ELM.

Now i'm not a developper anymore and i code for fun (when i have enought time
and motivation). The [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)'s
_COMPUTERCYNICS lectures also changed the way i think computer industry.

i'm interested improving skills in many fields without having enought time.
including GUI/DataViz, low level (plan9 kernel?), functionnal programming
(finally be productive with haskell, clojure and so on). 

# the tools i use

* my prefered shell is _ZSH. _UZE is my attempt to build an ecosystem on it
 (using namespaces, tests and shippable libraries).
* my prefered linux distributions are _DEBIAN when the main purpose
  is stability and _ARCH to experiment very new stuff. rpm based distributions
  desapointed me every time i tried them and the next distro i'll give a chance
  to will be _NIXOS. If i have an opportunity to work with a BSD again
  (i loved the experience), it would be _NETBSD.
* _VIM is my only one editor for much more than editing (i use it as
  interactive client for RT, SQL and LDAP servers, mail composition, ...).
* my prefered window manager is _DWM but i use _GNOME at work because
  it is a much better candidate to promote linux as a desktop-ready solution
  (i actually found it much better than Mac)
* under , i use _CYGWIN, _VIM, _PUTTY, powershell,
  [git extensions](https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?)
