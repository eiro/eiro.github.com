hello people,

We [1] are planning to host the 2019 edition of the french perl workshop
(aka Journées perl) at the atrium of the university of Strasbourg on June 13 to
15 or 20 to 22 (please quickly tell us about your preferences).

Perl(http://www.perl.org) is used in many huge projects who need more time to
code together, not to attend conferences. So this time, we don't really bet on
talks this time.  instead we want to gather people involved in the maintainance
of huge perl projects to give everyone the opportunity to

* team work on their projects (we setup your hackathon)
* share ideas, skills, tools and many libraries
* learn new things by running tutorials with experts over your shoulders

[1] who are "we":

* [Mongueurs de Perl](http://mongueurs.net/)
* [Unistra](http://www.unistra.fr/)
* [Renater](https://www.renater.fr/)
* [Alsace Réseau Neutre ARN FAI](http://arn-fai.net/)
